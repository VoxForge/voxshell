Speech Recognition Shell

VoxForge & Julius Quick Start.

This Tar file contains everything you need to get Julius working:
 * Julius Run-time engine executable;
 * VoxForge Acoustic Model files;
 * VoxForge sample Grammar files.

Extract the gzipped tar file to a directory, and execute the following command:
 
  $./julius -input mic -C Sample.jconf

For information on the Julius grammar syntax, see the enclosed GRAMMAR_NOTES.

Note that we need many more speech submissions to create decent quality Acoustic 
Models.  Please take the time to submit some transcribed speech to www.voxforge.org.

thank you,

VoxForge.
